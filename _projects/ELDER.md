As part of the Spring 2019 Space Systems Engineering capstone (16.83) at MIT, I designed a mission to Enceladus, Saturn.

Our advisor, [Prof Dava Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dava_Newman), gave us this very open-ended challenge (in fact we had to pick our destination too).

I designed our missions trajectory, and either sized or selected off-the-shelf spacecraft components.

Our design review slides are [here]({{site.url}}/files/ELDER_CDR.pdf), the spacecraft design teams final report is [here]({{site.url}}/files/ELDER_Spacecraft_Design.pdf) and the trajectory report is [here]({{site.url}}/files/ELDER_Trajectory.pdf)


More details coming soon.
