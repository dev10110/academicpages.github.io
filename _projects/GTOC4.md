We are tackling the problem from Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC) 4, where we need to find a low-thrust trajectory that flybys as many asteroids as possible (from a specified list of 1436 asteroids) in ten years. [Full Problem Statement](https://sophia.estec.esa.int/gtoc_portal/?page_id=23)

Our current working GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/Yuricst/reGTOC04)

More details coming soon.
