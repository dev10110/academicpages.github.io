Education
======
* BEng & MEng, Aeronautical Engineering with a Year Abroad, Imperial College London (Expected)
* (Non-degree), Year Exchange Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Work/Research experience
======
* Summer 2019: UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program)
  * Imperial, Space Lab
  * Designed 1U propellant tank for cube-sat, to be manufactured and tested early 2020.
  * Supervisor: [Prof Aaron Knoll](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.knoll)

* Fall 2018 - Spring 2019: UROP
  * [MIT, Electric Aircraft Initiative](http://electricaircraft.mit.edu)
  * Developed 2D models to predict thruster performance, correcting some of the underlying physics of a previous version of the code.  
  * Supervisor: [Prof Steven Barrett](http://barrett.mit.edu) and [Haofeng Xu](http://lae.mit.edu/team/haofeng-xu/)
  * Published in Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6463/ab4a4c)

* Summer 2018: Research Engineer Internship
  * Dyson, Floorcare Separation Systems Research Team
  * Studied gas cyclone aerodynamics, developed simple analytic models to predict cyclone performance, and used it to propose and test new cyclone architectures for Dyson's vacuum cleaners.

* Summer 2017: UROP
  * Imperial, Robot Intelligence Lab
  * Self-proposed project to develop a rope climbing robot to allow distressed cavers to call for help from underground. Pitched and won Â£500 grant, and developed first prototype that could crawl on ropes in eight weeks.

Extra-curricular Activities
======
* Imperial College London Rocketry ([ICLR](https://iclr.webnode.com))
  * Founded society with aim to compete in [Spaceport America Cup](https://www.spaceportamericacup.com). Lead conceptual design to launch 8.8 lb payload to 10,000 ft using a scratch-built hybrid (parrafin + N2O) rocket engine. Currently leading systems and integration team.
  * Read more the project page.
* [MIT Rocket Team](http://rocketry.mit.edu)
  * Structures team, focused on aerothermo and aeroelastic analysis and testing on rocket. The rocket was designed for 80,000 ft and reaches Mach 3.5. Built a bespoke aerothermo calculator to analyse tip heating.
* [Imperial Drone Society] (https://www.facebook.com/imperialdronesoc/)
  * Founded society, to build a hotspot for drone activity, to teach students about drones, to work on new ideas, and to increase awareness in the greater public. Society has grown to 120+ members. I've organised large events and executed a number of very popular training classes, and a 3D printing drone competition.
