I'm Dev, a graduating senior studying aeronautical engineering from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics). I'm really interested in anything space, and am keen to see our societies move beyond our basically 2D existence on Earth's surface. We really should explore our neighbourhood more, if not for the ['give humanity a second chance'](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html/2#part2 waitbutwhy is an amazing blog) perspective, from a 'wouldn't it be cool?' perspective.

I'm always involved in a bunch of [projects](projects), have [published](publications) some of my work, and might occasionally try to share something cool on the [blog](blog). My CV is available [here](cv). Take a look around, and feel free to contact me at devansh [dot] agrawal [at] gmail [dot] com.
